Introduction
------------

The Marche daemon provides the possibility to control system services via several remote interfaces.
It's written in Python and was originally developed to control system services at the FRM-II_/MLZ_ neutron source.

The main features are:
  - Remote access for starting, stopping and restarting services
  - Remote access via multiple interfaces at the same time
  - Remote access to log files of the different services
  - Possibility to handle each type of service individually
